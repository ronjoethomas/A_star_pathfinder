# A_star_pathfinder
Uses A* pathfinding algorithm to find shortest path between 2 points in a grid

Note: this program uses the SFML library in order to create the GUI. If you want to run the program, make sure that this library is linked properly.

Essentially, the user clicks any valid location (not red blocked path) and the program gives the shortest valid path from the start point to the end point in green. Note the user cannot travel across the red blocks.

Below are 2 examples of the program runnning:

![Alt text](Astar/Project1/path_2_picture.PNG?raw=true "path2")
